<h3>Sri Caitanya Caritamrit</h3>
<p>As Bhagavad Gita is like graduation and Srimad Bhagavatam is like post graduation but Caitanya Caritamrit is like the PHD so its the topmost book in which Lord Caitanya's teachings are mentioned and it will take you to the beyond of your imagination i.e. Advancement in devotional service. </p>
